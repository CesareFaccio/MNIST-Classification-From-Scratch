# MNIST-Classification-From-Scratch

Implimentation of neural network from scratch, limiting my libraries to numpy, pandas and matplotlib. The network is then trained to classify hand written numbers from the MNIST dataset.

The neural network is easy to initialise with custom number of layers and dimensions.

I have not included train.csv or test.csv but these can be easily downloaded from "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview"
